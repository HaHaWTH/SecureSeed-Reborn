# SecureSeed-Reborn

State-of-the-art cryptography to protect your world seed against seed cracking tools.

## Description

This mod is a partial port of the SecureSeed mod for Minecraft 1.16, it changes vanilla 64-bit seed to a 1024-bit seed, making it impossible to crack the seed. Not only that, there are a lot of things changed related to how random generation works.

There is no link between the generation of different features. For example, a link between diamonds and clay.

The terrain and biomes stays the same. But all the ores, structures, villages, strongholds, spawners, clay patches, geodes, lava pools, slime chunks â€” would appear in different places from the original seed. Because they are generated with all the fancy technology from the Secure Seed mod. Meaning there is no way that players can abuse the seed to find ores or structures.
